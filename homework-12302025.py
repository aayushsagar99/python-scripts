print("Q2: Is Python an interpreted language? Prove this statement.\n")

print ("Answer: \n")

print("Yes. Python is an interpreted language: the interpreter executes code line by line, translating   \
each statement to machine instructions and running it immediately. This makes testing and debugging   \
faster because you see results without compiling the entire program first. By contrast, compiled   \
languages like C or Java must be fully translated into machine code before they can run.\n")
